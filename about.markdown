Well, not much to say about me, I'm IT guy who plays Badminton, drives motorcycles and occasionally travels.

About this site? Well, I previously had a <abbr title="Virtual Private Server">VPS</abbr> hosted at <a href="https://www.datacenter.eu">Datacenter Luxembourg S.A.</a> which was my previous employer.
It was built using <a href="https://nanoc.app/">Nanoc app</a> which is a static content site generator, one of the first releases of <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Twitter's bootstrap</a>.
Anyway, I stopped maintaining it because it was quite burdensome to keep the server updated, publishing was tedious as I had to maintain a complete development thing on my computer and 
also I completely didn't want to upgrade from bootstrap 1.4 to 2.x at the time as I botched the grid system ...

Long story short, here comes this website using <a href="https://pages.github.com/">github pages</a> based on <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> and the default <a href="https://github.com/jekyll/minima/tree/master">minima</a> theme.
